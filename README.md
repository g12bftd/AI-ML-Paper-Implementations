# ML-Paper-Implementations

These are my implementations of some interesting papers in the machine learning community
The following papers are implemented:

- [Densely Connected Convolutional Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) (see [DenseCNN](https://github.com/g12bftd/AI-ML-Paper-Implementations/tree/main/DenseCNN))
- [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
- [Colorful Image Colorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08511)
- [Deep Feature Interpolation for Image Content Changes](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05507)
- [Scaling the Scattering Transform: Deep Hybrid Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08961) 
- [Self-Normalizing Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02515.pdf)
- [Sobolev Training for Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04859)
- [pix2pix: Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.07004v1.pdf)
- [Effective Approaches to Attention-based Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025)
